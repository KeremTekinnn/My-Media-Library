## About My Media Library

My Media Library is a web application built with Laravel, a framework with expressive, elegant syntax. This application allows users to upload, manage, and view their media files in a central location. Here are some of the key features:

- **Photo Upload**: Users can select and upload multiple photos at once. The upload process starts immediately after the selection of photos.
- **Upload Progress Feedback**: During the upload process, a progress bar or similar indicator is displayed. Users receive a notification when the upload is successfully completed or if it fails.
- **Media Library**: All uploaded photos are displayed in a grid or list format, with the newest uploads shown first. Each photo has a thumbnail for quick identification.
- **Photo Descriptions**: Users have the option to add a description to each photo during the upload process. This description is stored in the database along with the photo.
- **Photo Deletion**: Users can delete uploaded photos. A confirmation is required before the photo is permanently deleted.
- **Photo Search**: Users can search for photos based on the filename or description. The search results are filtered immediately based on the search query.
- **File Size Limit**: Administrators can limit the size of the uploaded files to manage server space efficiently. Users receive an error message if the file is too large.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
